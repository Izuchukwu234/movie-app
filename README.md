This is a responsive Movie App I personally built for fun. I used TMDB free API and jumped straight using Vanilla JS. Its responsive, gives you the ability to search for movies and also to add your favorite movies. Its landing page gives trending movies straight from the actual and current trending films from TMDB API.
